<h1 align="center">DummyDBG</h1>

  This project is me trying to genuinely understand how do debuggers work under the hood and eventually create one myself using every source of information that i could possibly find on the internet


## The goals I set for myself in this project:
- [ ] Use git submodules 
- [ ] Use cmake
- [ ] Remote debugging
